# Code Collection Museum

Welcome to the Code Collection Museum! This repository is a complete collection of code examples, scripts, and Python projects that have been created, developed, or used in various programming competitions. This repository is a collection of code snippets, solutions, and projects that I have developed and collected from various Python competitions that I have participated in. Whether it's a winning submission or a very useful implementation, this collection aims to provide insights, learning resources, and practical examples for fellow enthusiasts, beginners, and experienced programmers alike. With this repository, it is hoped that some programming results will be useful and help those who want to start learning. Apart from that, we can also exchange ideas and share suggestions in programming development.

We hope this repository provides you with benefit and inspiration in your programming journey. Thank you for joining this collection!
